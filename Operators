In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values. Here are some of the commonly used Python operators:

Arithmetic Operators:

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus)
** (Exponentiation)
// (Floor Division)
Example:

python

a = 10
b = 3
sum_result = a + b
Comparison Operators:

== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
< (Less than)
> (Greater than)
<= (Less than or equal to)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
Example:

python

x = 5
y = 10
is_equal = x == y
Logical Operators:

and (Logical AND)
or (Logical OR)
not (Logical NOT)
Example:

python

p = True
q = False
result = p and q
Assignment Operators:

= (Assignment)
+= (Add and assign)
-= (Subtract and assign)
*= (Multiply and assign)
/= (Divide and assign)
%= (Modulus and assign)
Example:

python

x = 5
x += 3  # equivalent to x = x + 3
Identity Operators:

is (True if the operands are identical)
is not (True if the operands are not identical)
Example:

python

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
is_identical = a is b
Membership Operators:

in (True if a value is found in the sequence)
not in (True if a value is not found in the sequence)
Example:

python

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
is_present = 3 in my_list
